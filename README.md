Using Unsupervised Learning to understand responses to Multidimensional Sexual Self-Concept Questionnaire

Introduction
Sexual self-concept is a persons own view of their sexual behaviours and actions.

The MSSCQ was created by Dr. William E. Snell, Jr. in 1995 for the general study of sexuality. It measures along twenty separate scales.

The inventory consists of one hundred statements that must be rated on how characteristic they are of the subject. The test should not take most people more than eight minutes.
